Hi, there! I’m Žiga, a freshman undergraduate at Cornell, studying Computer Science and Mathematics.  My interests include computer graphics, 3D computer vision, and machine learning, specifcially in connection to realistic rendering, automatic content generation, and XR.

I'm fortunate enough to be resaerching with prof. <a href='http://abedavis.com/'>Abe Davis</a> at Cornell this summer as a part of the CSURP summer program.

Currently I'm a TA for a core CS class on OOP and DS and the tech subteam lead for CIFT - Cornell Innovative Film and Technology club.
